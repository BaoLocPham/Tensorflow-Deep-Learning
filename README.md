  I started to studying for the Tensorflow Certificate seriously in **30th July 2021** (honestly, i started in 15th but i was busy studying for final semester exam in my University), and I took the exam in **29th August 2021**.
  I was very nervous but don't worry, you can do it too.

## üìù Repository learning Tensorflow and reparing for Tensorflow Certificate exam

  My study routine:
  * I spend about 2 days to studying each module.
  * Beside notebook, read book and watch online lecture to understand the concept underlying the code.
  * Working with preprocess data and fine tune hyperparameters beside the building models.
  * Fix bugs, yes, there are lots of bugs when i coded like dimension error, versions error, etc.


  My development environment:
  * Google colab (thanks google for offer free GPU üôè).
  * Pycharm (recommend because the Exam use PyCharm IDE).
  * ...

  About the notebook environment when i was created:
  * Python == 3.8.x
  * Tensorflow == 2.5.x
  
  If you run these on collab, the environment or some TensorFlow module will be a little bit different.
