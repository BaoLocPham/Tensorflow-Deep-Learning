# Tensorflow Deep Learing Fundamentals
  
  I start to study for the Tensorflow Certificate seriously in 30th July 2021 (honestly is 15th but i was busy studying for final semester exam in my University), and I took the exam in 29th August 2021.
  
## üìù Repository learning Tensorflow and reparing for Tensorflow Certificate exam

  My study routine:
  * I spend about 2 days to studying each module.
  * Beside notebook, read book and watch online lecture to understand the concept underlying the code.
  * Working with preprocess data and fine tune hyperparameters beside the building models.
  * Fix bugs, yes, there are lots of bugs when i coded like dimension error, etc.


  My development environment:
  * Google colab (thanks google for offer free GPU üôè).
  * Pycharm (recommend because the Exam use PyCharm IDE).
  * ...
